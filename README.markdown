== JavaScript DSL for Classical Inheritance

This files provides a DSL for the following design patterns: 

* inheritance
* interface
* module

Neon packs a DSL for Class creation, that helps in making programs following an object oriented design.

The philosophy is that it should not try to emulate other languages, so it preserves the JavaScript good parts,
but with a nicer syntax to create classes that ensure interfaces and include reusable functionality as modules.

=== Usage

    Interface('Editable')({
        constructor : ['x'],
        prototype   : ['x']
    });

    Module('Composition')({
        y : 5,
        prototype : {
            z : 3
        }
    });

    Module('Other')({
        a : 5,
        prototype : {
            b : 3
        }
    });

    Class('Overlay').inherits(Widget).ensures(Editable).includes(Composition, Other)({
        html : '<div></div>',
        prototype : {
            init : function (element){
                if(!element){
                    element = document.createElement('div');
                    element.innerHTML = 'hello';
                    document.body.appendChild(element);
                }
            },
            b : 5
        }
    });
